# M-Brane rules

While working on an M-Brane project, we ask you to respect the following rules:

## Work culture

- Pay attention to everyone's opinion
- Trust and have confidence in the team (don't give orders)
- Get the best tools or ask for them
- Always ask questions
- Always answer questions without judging

## Communication

- Every working day, send a message in #standup to update the team
- No one is expected to reply immediately
- Over-communicate everything

## Engineers

### Code

- Use prettier
- Type everything

### Creating pull requests

- Give an explicit title
- Add Screenshots/Gifs
- [Link it to the relevant issue](Closing Issues via Pull Requests)
- Make the title obvious
- [Emojis are cool](./pr-message-emoji.md)

### Pull request review

- Go into a PR review with an open mind. Coding is as much art as it is science
- If you commit to reviewing code, review it thoroughly
- Aim to understand every changed line
- If you criticise, propose an alternative
