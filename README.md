# M-Brane rules

While working on an M-Brane project, we ask you to respect the following rules:

## Work culture

- Pay attention to everyone's opinion
- Trust and have confidence in the team (don't give orders)
- Get the best tools or ask for them

## Communication

- Always ask questions
- Always answer questions without judging
- Every working day, send a message in #standup to update the team
- No one is expected to reply immediately
- Over-communicate everything

## Engineers

### Code

- Use prettier
- Type everything

### Creating pull requests

- Make the title obvious
- [Link it to the relevant issue(s)](https://blog.github.com/2013-05-14-closing-issues-via-pull-requests)
- Add Screenshots/Gifs
- [Emojis are cool](./pr-message-emoji.md)

### Pull request review

- Go into a PR review with an open mind. Coding is as much art as it is science
- If you commit to reviewing code, review it thoroughly
- Aim to understand every changed line
- If you criticise, propose an alternative
